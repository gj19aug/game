Enemy Ship Design
=================

- Enemies spawn off-camera
	- Amount spawned based on Ship Size? Game time? Some way to scale difficulty with success (probably Ship Size)
	- Variable to active count all AI in Game Area. (I might be able to do this myself.)
- Enemies could shoot more than one projectile, or have more than just basic weapons decided on Spawn.
	- Help keep it fresh
	- Could colorize based on weapon.
- Occasionally, spawn a wave of a large amount to throw at player. 
- (STRETCH) Use the cockpit area drawn in EnemyFighter1 as built in "health bar". Could colorize based on Health? Green for healthy, red for dying? 
	- Colorize the rest of the ship based on weapon type. 


Enemy AI Flow
================
- Spawn
- Find and Move to Player Postion + varRange to strafe around target. Prevent trying to collide inside Player unit. 
- Shoot toward Player Origin while trying to maintain varRange distance. 
- On Death, spawn variable amount of Debris.
